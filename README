This project is a collection of scripts for building an IP2AS database.
Included is a script for hooking into powerdns enabling one to query the
DNS server for an IP and returning information regarding it's AS
as well as some details of that AS.

Functionality inspired by the Team Cymru "IP to ASN Mapping" service[0].


Uses data from:
 - ftp.arin.net/pub/stats/arin/delegated-arin-latest
 - ftp.ripe.net/ripe/stats/delegated-ripencc-latest
 - ftp.afrinic.net/pub/stats/afrinic/delegated-afrinic-latest
 - ftp.apnic.net/pub/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest
 - ftp.lacnic.net/pub/stats/lacnic/delegated-lacnic-latest
 - http://www.cidr-report.org


Dependencies:
 - python (tested with v2.6) (better performance with pypy)
 - RIPE's bgpdump[1]
 - SubnetTree[2]
 - PowerDNS (optional)


Setup:
 - setup a cronjob to regularly call "update.sh"

Usage:
 1. use the powerdns pipebackend
